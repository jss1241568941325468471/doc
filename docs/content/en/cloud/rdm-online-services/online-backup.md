{% snippet, "badgeInfo" %}
***{{ en.OBACK }}*** will be removed from the {{ en.DPORTAL }}. You can still [access the URL](/rdm/kb/general-knowledge/rdm-online-services-removed-devolutions-portal/) if needed.
{% endsnippet %}

The ***{{ en.OBACK }}*** allows you to backup your {{ en.DOD }}, SQLite, and XML data sources in a safe online cloud storage. It will automatically save your sessions when you initiate a change in {{ en.RDM }}.

It is available for free in {{ en.RDM }} Free and Team Editions.

You will be able to delete your backup files from your ***{{ en.RDMOS }}***, but you will have to create the ***{{ en.OBACK }}*** from your {{ en.RDM }} application.

Consult [{{ en.OBACK }} Settings - Windows Edition](/rdm/windows/commands/file/backup/backup-settings/) or [{{ en.OBACK }} Settings - Mac Edition](/rdm/mac/commands/file/backup/settings/) for more information on the configuration.
