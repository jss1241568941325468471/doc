  title: Login failed for UserX with SQL
---
If the "(0x80131904): Login failed for user 'UserX'" error code appears when attempting to connect to the data source, it is possible that the account has been locked after multiple login attempts. It depends on the configured password policy enforcement. 

## Unlocking the SQL Database
The following SQL Query will confirm if the user has been locked: SELECT LOGINPROPERTY('UserX','islocked')  

The user can be manually unlocked by going to the user ***Properties*** â€“ ***Status*** and unchecking ***Lock SQL user***. Then changing the password and finally executing the changes. 

### Alternative
Alternatively, the following query can be used:

ALTER LOGIN [SQLID] WITH PASSWORD = '****' UNLOCK
