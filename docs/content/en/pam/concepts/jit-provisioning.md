***JIT (just-in-time) provisioning*** offers a lower exposure risk due to the lack of permanent high-privileged account permissions. On checkout, an account is created with the appropriate memberships and deleted upon check-in. JIT provisioning shifts the burden from monitoring many existing accounts to monitoring fewer permanent ones.
