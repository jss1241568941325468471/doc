An ***identity provider*** is an external service that a {{ en.DPAM }} provider manages.

Identity providers are always external to {{ en.DPAM }} and store the accounts that {{ en.DPAM }} manages through actions. Examples of identity providers include [Microsoft Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-default-user-accounts), [MySQL databases](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/user-names.html), [Windows operating systems](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/manage-user-accounts-in-windows-104dc19f-6430-4b49-6a2b-e4dbd1dcdf32), and [Linux operating systems](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-user-group-management). An identity provider is the identity management service that facilitates [authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication,_authorization,_and_accounting) of identities.
