A ***privileged account*** (PA) in Devolutions PAM is an account used to perform highly privileged actions. Due to their breadth of access, traditional targets are IT infrastructure, service, and administrator accounts. However, non-IT users with access to sensitive data or processes, such as those in legal and finance, are also considered highly privileged.
