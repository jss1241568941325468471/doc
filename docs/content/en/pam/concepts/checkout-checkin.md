    In the context of privileged accounts (PAs), check-out and check-in refer to
    reserving a PA for a user's exclusive usage for a finite period.
---
***Check-out*** and ***check-in*** refer to reserving, or locking, a privileged account for a user's exclusive usage for a finite period. Typically, a password rotation occurs upon check-in, releasing the exclusive lock. This process can happen:

* At the end of the checkout duration
* Manually
* When the session is closed in {{ en.RDM }} With just-in-time (JIT) access, the group or role memberships of privileged accounts are modified upon check-out and restored to their initial state upon check-in.
