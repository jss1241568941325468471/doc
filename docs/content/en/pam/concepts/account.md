An ***account*** is an identity managed by a {{ en.DPAM }} provider.

Accounts are stored on external identity providers. An account can be thought of as an identity assigned to a person or service, such as a user account with a username and password, a certificate, or a [Microsoft Azure AD application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser).

For example, an account could be a user account in Microsoft Active Directory for an employee in HR, or it could be a certificate attached to a web server for encrypting web traffic. An account establishes an identity that links both authorization and access levels to a person or service.
