Devolutions offers pre-configured propagation script templates on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Devolutions/PAM-Providers/tree/master/Propagation-Scripts). These are free to download and modify, and can help administrators propagate scripts without having to create complex custom scripts and templates.

## Importing a template into {{ en.DVLS }}
Once the desired template is downloaded from Devolutions GitHub propagation script repository, open {{ en.DVLS }}, head over to ***Administration*** – ***Privileged access*** – ***Propagation (preview)***, and click on the ***Script templates*** icon.

Then, click on the ***Import*** icon:

Browse the computer for the .json template file previously downloaded from the propagation scripts GitHub repository or drag and drop the file in the upload box (in this case a password propagation script for {{ en.DVLS }}). Click on ***Import***.

The template's name, description, properties, property mapping, and script itself can then be modified if need be. When this is done – or if it is not neccessary – click on ***Save*** to complete the template's importation.
