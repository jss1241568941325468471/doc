Roles and permissions can be assigned in {{ en.DHUBB }} for each level by following a few simple steps.

To edit roles and permissions within a specific entry or folder, click on the ellipsis button next an entry name:

![{{ en.VLT_MAJ }} level roles & permissions – Ellipsis button](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB4023_2024_2.png)

Alternatively, admins can go to ***Administration*** – ***{{ en.VLT_MAJ }}s***, and click on the ***Edit*** icon next to the {{ en.VLT }} to modify:

![{{ en.VLT_MAJ }} level roles & permissions – via Administration](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB4025_2024_2.png)

Regardless of the path chosen, the same ***{{ en.VLT_MAJ }}*** window should appear. Select the ***Security*** section and click the ***Edit*** tab to manage roles and permissions:
