  title: Run As {{ en.ANYID }} PowerShell scripts with execution context
  description: This topic will cover how to run various PowerShell scripts calling {{ en.ANYID }} providers in {{ en.DVLS }} within a certain context.
---
The ***Run As*** option lets you run {{ en.ANYID }} provider scripts within different contexts and runs the scheduler to do so. This can be done on a local or a remote machine, making it useful to find out what the script is trying to accomplish, whether it is completing certain actions or accessing certain files.
{% snippet, "badgeHelp" %}
{{ en.DVLS }} already includes Azure Key Vault and Windows Accounts [custom scripts](/pam/kb/how-to-articles/create-anyidentity-pam-provider-dvls/#import-an-anyidentity-template) templates.
{% endsnippet %}

## Run As PowerShell script in various contexts
1. In {{ en.DVLS }}, go to ***Administration*** – ***Privileged Access*** – ***Providers***.
1. Click on ***Add***.

1. Click on the ***Run As*** tab.

1. In the ***Credential*** dropdown select either;
    * Default: Runs the script with the current scheduler configuration.
    * Custom: Runs the script within a specified ***Username***, ***Password*** and ***Host Name***.

   It is advised to pick or create a user with less permissions to test a script.
   {% endsnippet %}

1. Click ***Save*** to close this window and save the changes.

### Check for trusted hosts
If ***Run As*** is not pointing to a trusted host, the configuration will not work.

Here is the command line to fetch trusted hosts: `Get-Item "WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts"`

Here is the command line to update the local machine's trusted hosts with a certain value: `Set-Item 'WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts' -Value '*' -Force`
{% snippet, "shieldCaution" %}
Make certain to replace the `*` in the command above. If left as is the `*` acts as a wildcard, which would make every remote host become trusted.
{% endsnippet %}

{% snippet, "badgeHelp" %}
Read the topic on [trusted hosts](/server/kb/how-to-articles/winrm-trustedhostslist/) for more information.
