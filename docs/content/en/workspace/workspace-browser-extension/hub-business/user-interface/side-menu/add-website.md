The ***Add website*** button is only available while in the [***Matching***](/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/hub-business/user-interface/side-menu/#matching-tab) tab, which is the tab selected when opening the extension, or when browsing through the {{ en.VLT }}s and entries of the [***{{ en.VLT_MAJ }}s***](/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/hub-business/user-interface/side-menu/#vaults-tab) or [***{{ en.UVLT_MAJ }}***](/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/hub-business/user-interface/side-menu/#user-vault-tab) tabs. It opens a new tab in your browser that allows you to add a website entry in {{ en.DHUBB }} through the {{ en.WBEX }}.

When {{ en.DHUBB }} is used as the data source, the basic entry configuration is done in the ***General*** tab, but other parameters are also available in other tabs. Below is an example of the ***General*** tab settings when creating a website entry. ![New entry – Website (General tab)](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4106_2024_2.png "New entry – Website &#40;General tab&#41;")

The tables below list all fields/settings available in the ***New entry – Website*** window. The different sections represent the left menu tabs.

### General

\| FIELD/SETTING \| DESCRIPTION \| \| --- \| --- \| \| Name \| Enter a name for your entry. This field is automatically filled in by the {{ en.WBEX }}, but can still be modified. \| \| {{ en.VLT_MAJ }} \| Choose the {{ en.VLT }} in which to store your new website entry in {{ en.DHUBB }}. You can select any available {{ en.VLT }}, including your ***{{ en.UVLT }}***. \| \| Folder \| Enter the name of the folder in which your new entry will be stored in {{ en.DHUBB }}. \| \| Host \| Select in the drop-down list how the {{ en.WBEX }} will fetch the host between ***Custom***, ***Linked ({{ en.VLT }})***, or ***Inherited***. If you select ***Custom***, the ***URL*** field (see below) will appear. If you select ***Linked ({{ en.VLT }})***, a drop-down list will appear in which you will be able to select the host. \| \| URL \| Enter the URL of the website’s login page. This field is automatically filled in by the {{ en.WBEX }}, but can still be modified. \| \| Credentials \| Select in the drop-down list between ***Custom***, ***Linked ({{ en.VLT }})***, ***Inherited***, ***My personal credentials***, ***Find by name ({{ en.UVLT }})***, or ***None*** to specify to the {{ en.WBEX }} how to retrieve your credentials. Some of these options give you access to additional settings. \| \| Username \| Enter the username you use to log in to the website. <br> <br> This field is only available if ***Custom*** is selected in the ***Credentials*** drop-down list. \| \| Domain \| Enter a domain for the website. <br> <br> This field is only available if ***Custom*** is selected in the ***Credentials*** drop-down list. \| \| Password \| Enter the password you use to log in to the website. The password will be hidden. Below the field is a strength indicator for your password. <br> <br> This field is only available if ***Custom*** is selected in the ***Credentials*** drop-down list. \| \| Reveal/Hide password \| Reveal or hide the password that was entered. <br> <br> This field is only available next to the ***Password*** field if ***Custom*** is selected in the ***Credentials*** drop-down list. \| \| Password Generator \| Open the ***Password Generator*** window, which allows you to create a strong and secure password adapted to your needs and to website requirements. \| \| Compare type \| Select how the entered URL is compared and matched to the website URL.
