  title: Unpair a browser extension (Windows)
---
In the event that you want to deny access to {{ en.RDMWIN }} from a previously paired browser extension, you need to delete it from {{ en.RDM }}.

1. In {{ en.RDM }}, go to ***File – Settings – Browser Extensions***.
2. In the ***{{ en.WBEX }} Associations*** section, click the ***X*** button of the entry in the list, then click ***OK*** to save the modifications. {% snippet, "badgeInfo" %}
   In the ***{{ en.WBEX }} Associations*** section, you will find a list of each association made to {{ en.RDM }}, including some information to identify them. This includes the name specified at the time of the association (which defaults to the web browser’s name), a part of the encryption key used between the two, its creation date, and the date when it was last used.
